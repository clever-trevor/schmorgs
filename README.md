ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @schmorgs, and this repository is a collection of various things I've worked on over the years

ðŸ‘€ I love programming but it's mainly as a hobby, and I will happily spend a week setting up a monitor for my Freezer (it broke once and I didn't know for 3 days!!)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python3 and would love an opportunity to collaborate on some bigger project if anyone needs help.

My professional background is in Enterprise monitoring, providing solutions in the infrastructure, application, network and cloud spaces.
There's a repo here which is an OpenSource based project built around the TICK stack which I'm particularly proud of, so do let me know if you have any questions about it
